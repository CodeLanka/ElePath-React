# ElePath-React
Elephant Transit Home is a facility provided by Udawalawa National Park, Sri Lanka. It was initiated by the Department of Wildlife Conservation making a major step towards the welfare and conservation of orphaned elephants in 1995. 
Elephant Transit Home which is also known as 'Ath Athuru Sewana' primarily takes care of elephant calves and disabled elephants until they are independent and able enough to be released back to the wild. 

It is with high importance to track the locations of released animals while they are on the move in the wild to ensure their well-being. This application is a valuable contribution towards the tracking of released animals in the wild.
